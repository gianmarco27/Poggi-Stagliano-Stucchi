## Scenarios

#### Scenario 1

A basketball team coach wants to adopt a new training method that requires him to monitor constantly the players, so he asks them to subscribe to Data4Help and allow him to access their data.

        Insert here the subscription of the players (using their personal information).

He proceeds to register himself as a third party, then he requests via SSN the players' data. Data4Help forwards the requests to the specified users, and as previously agreed, they accept so from now on the coach can track his team.

#### Scenario 2

A statistic institute wants to conduct a research on the health status of people aged 25 in Romano di Lombardia, in order to collect the nedeed data they decide to exploit the service offered by Data4Help, so they specify their data preferences on Data4Help portal. 
Since the request doesn't fit the privacy constraints of the service, the acces to the data is denied, the institute sends a new request widening the search to people between 24 and 26 years old. Now the request fits the privacy constraints and Data4Help sends the specified data to the institute.

#### Scenario 3

Giovanni is 80 years old and suffers of a heart disease, since he lives alone he decided to register to AutomatedSOS.  
On first access to the service he specified the theresholds of his heartbeat outside of which he wants to be assisted by his local emergency service.
