   1. Introduction
  </h2>
  <h3 id="a-purpose">
   A. Purpose
  </h3>
  <p>
   The purpose of the following document is to provide an overview of what are the requirements and goals of the system that the company, called TrackMe, wants to develop. The subject of the document is made up by three macro-functionalities that together concurr to give to the company customers a complete tracking, managing and share services of their personal data that nowadays are easily collectable with common  wearable devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Different type of stakeholders are addressed by the complex application, the three functionalities, in fact, try to separate in different levels this type of users, or stakeholders in general.
   <br/>
   The First, Data4Help is the most general-purpose one, it is addressed to any type of user that simply wants to be tracked and share their informations in a way in which their privacy is assured to be never violated, independently from what is the aim of the tracking. The sharing aspect of the application is given by the possibility of providing filters that can simply be referred to a single person, or to categories of users selected with respect to some constraint binded to the amount of people belonging to the specified category.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    AutomatedSOS
   </strong>
   is a specific service, it is addressed to elderly people that want to be sure that, in case of health problem, their wearable devices, collaborating with the system, can quickly contact the local emergency service in order to receive a proper assistance. AutomatedSOS gives the possibility to specify what are the critical parameters that have to be monitored and what are the correct values in which they are supposed to be, then periodically checks data, using the provided APIs to contact local services when anomalies appears.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Track4Run
   </strong>
   is mainly addressed to runners, sports fan and organizers of running events. The service allows to choose, runs to which users want to subscribe or which they want to spectate, providing general information regarding the path, the starting time and a  description. Organizers mainly uses the application in order to collect subscription in an easy and distributed way. People that want to spectate runs, don’t have to be logged to the service, they are simply able to follow the progress of the run on a map.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   is the base layer of all the complex system, active users of
   <strong>
    Track4Run
   </strong>
   or
   <strong>
    AutomatedSOS
   </strong>
   are, in fact, previously registered to it, this is possible because of the general purpose of this component, though which specializing higher level functionalities and being open to new one is even simpler.

   B. Scope
  </h3>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   is a service with the purpose of providing its users with two different tipe of services, people can sign up to Data4Help via their
   <strong>
    SSN
   </strong>
   in order to have their health parameters monitored along with their current position, meanwhile Third Parties can subscribe utilizing their
   <strong>
    VAT
   </strong>
   in order to request and retrieve both individuals’ and groups’ data.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   handles groups’ data requests having care of not disclosing informations that would compromise the anonimity of single individuals.
   <br/>
   Users data are registered thanks to monitoring devices (such as smart-watches, fitness tracker, etc).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Third Parties
   </strong>
   can retrieve single individuals data, upon user confirmation, by using his
   <strong>
    SSN
   </strong>
   as a filter, and group’s data by providing filters, wide enough to not violate the users privacy, regarding the collected data or anagraphical parameters. Privacy is assured adopting a simple policy that covers both the cases of individuals’ and groups’ requests: the first is simple passing the request to the individual addressed who can decide to accept or deny the access to his data, the second is managed internally by the system that returns data only if a sufficient number of users is addressed by the request.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addiction to this core service, two more targeted ones,
   <strong>
    AutomatedSOS
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Track4Run
   </strong>
   , rely on it. This interaction allows the user to have his data shared across the three services on need, just by providing his own
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   credentials.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    AutomatedSOS
   </strong>
   takes the service offered by
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   to the next level to its subscribes users, in fact, as long as the registered users are provided with accurate enough monitoring devices,
   <strong>
    AutomatedSOS
   </strong>
   guarantees them to keep them constantly monitored, basing on parameters and thresholds provided at the moment of registration, reaching out to the user local emergency service within 5 seconds from when the emergency has been detected, communicating the location of the user and the type of emergency detected (basing on the set parameters).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Track4run
   </strong>
   aims instead to offer a service on a complete different level, its users can be divided into two main categories: Organizers and final users.
   <br/>
   Organizers subscribe via their
   <strong>
    VAT
   </strong>
   and can use
   <strong>
    Track4Run
   </strong>
   to organize competitions by providing: title, path (drawning it on a map), starting time and a brief description, once this values are validated the run is created and inserted into a list of available runs for the final users.
  </p>
  <p>
   Final users can be divided in two groups: runners and spectators, they both access the same section of the service as guest users, once they have selected a run from the available’s list they can have two type of interactions: Either they enroll to the run, by accessing with their
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   account, for tracking purposes, or they choose to spectate the run, visualizing on a map the position of the runners on the track and their proceding.
   <br/>
   All of this is done by relying on the service
   <strong>
    Data4Help
   </strong>
   offers and the data it collects from the active users.

  <h4 id="c1-reliability">
   C.1 Reliability
  </h4>
  <p>
   AutomatedSOS has to guarantee to be online 24/7, accordingly to its function of monitoring periodically the data collected and sending notification to external entities. Track4Run systems hasn’t this type of constraints concerning reliability, because of its nature that is unrelated from an emergency application domain, it is acceptable that the service has some (short) period of time of unreachability, clearly guaranteeing that almost part of an entire run progress will be covered.
   <br/>
   Assuming that Data4Help represents the collecting service on which AutomatedSOS is based and condisering what is said above about it, Data4Help has to be 24/7 connected with the users’ devices, ready to receive monitoring data.
  </p>
  <h4 id="c2-availability">
   C.2 Availability
  </h4>
  <p>
   Working correctly at any time (limited by future infrastructure choices) is a constraint for AutomatedSOS and Data4Help, in fact if the failure time is overlapped with the time in which an health anomaly occurs, the emergency won’t be catched by the system and the function of the application won’t be accomplished. On the opposite side with Track4Run is possible to relax this requests because the goals of the system  don’t implicate that it has to work correctly every time.
  </p>
  <h4 id="c3-safety">
   C.3 Safety
  </h4>
  <p>
   According with the domain assumption D13 that runs in Track4Run are no-profit events and that in the entire system there aren’t any type of payment information exchanged between parties, the security implemented at the application level can be satisfying for the purpose of the application. The anonymisation of data operated by the system at the highest level (not considering any encryption at the HTTP level) is implemented by the application itself and so it’s not necessary any further requirement about this scope of interest.
  </p>
  <h4 id="c4-mantainability">
   C.4 Mantainability
  </h4>
  <p>
   since the nature of these three whole services is heavily binded (two of them directly rely on the main one for most of their functions), the system should be flexible and easy to mantain, as long as certain external constraints, such as the communication with monitoring devices or other services’ APIs are respected. Certainly following the design patterns will play a fundamental role on the application mantainability.
   <br/>
   Having a good documentation will be of key importance for the developers to achieve a good level of mantainability and clarifying the patterns to adopt on each case.
  </p>
  <h4 id="c5-compatibility">
   C.5 Compatibility
  </h4>
  <p>
   These services offer downloadable applications for individual users on their smartphone in order to connect with their monitoring device and record data anytime, moreover they are compatible with any monitoring device which are capable of monitoring the healt status of the individual. The services can be also accessed via web pages both for individuals and third parties to make use of the functions offered.

   4.  Formal analysis using alloy
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this section using alloy we describe the model specifying the constraints and the made use of the signature “Timestamp”, an object which instances allow us to specify the concept of time and its consecutivity.
   <br/>
   This is possible because every timestamp has a set of precedent timestamps and a set of successive timestamps, so if an instance has a timestamp we could tell if another istance happened before of after by looking up the timestamp in the set of previous and subsequents of the other.
   <br/>
   We have defined the signatures “AutomatedSOSUser” and “Track4Run” from the signature Individual using “in”, by doing so we define them as non disjointed subsets of “Individual” and therefore taking into account the possibility that there could be an Individual that is both an AutomatedSOSUser, a Runner at the same time.
